	<h1>Carbon Credits for Sale</h1>
	<p>Welcome to our website where you can purchase carbon credits to offset your carbon footprint. Our carbon credits are generated by a forest area that we own and manage. By buying our carbon credits, you can help support our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment.</p>

	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<p>When you purchase a carbon credit, you are essentially purchasing the right to offset one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions. We use the funds generated from the sale of carbon credits to maintain and expand our forest area, which absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>

	<h2>Pricing</h2>
	<p>Our carbon credits are priced at $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions. You can purchase as many credits as you need to offset your carbon footprint. We offer bulk discounts for purchases of more than 10 credits.</p>
